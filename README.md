# VulkanEngine

I have spent some time recently learning Vulkan after I had implemented the graphics pipeline in c++ as a refresher. A few tutorial series later, I now feel capable in using the api on my own. 

To deepen my understanding, I'm gradually writing a deffered renderer with PBR materials here and documenting my progress.

## 01.03.23 - First Commit

A simple obj. renderer with face ratio shading and z-buffer test is done! <br/> For convinience I use the new dynamic_rendering feature in version 1.3.
